:description: Pure PureScript layout algorithms for data visualization

Pure PureScript implementations of D3's layout algorithms for hierarchical data, flow diagrams, and relationship visualizations.

== What is Hylograph Layout?

Hylograph Layout provides layout algorithms that compute positions and dimensions for visualization elements. These are pure functions that transform your data into renderable coordinates.

[source,purescript]
----
import DataViz.Layout.Hierarchy.Tree as Tree
import DataViz.Layout.Hierarchy.Core as H

-- Build hierarchy from your data
let root = H.hierarchy myData getChildren

-- Apply tree layout
let laid = Tree.tree (Tree.defaultConfig { size = { width: 800.0, height: 600.0 } }) root

-- Now each node has x, y coordinates

== Available Layouts

=== Hierarchy Layouts

For tree-structured data:

* *Tree* - Classic dendrogram/tree layout
* *Cluster* - Tree with leaves aligned
* *Treemap* - Space-filling rectangles
* *Partition* - Sunburst/icicle diagrams
* *Pack* - Circle packing

=== Flow Layouts

For flow and relationship data:

* *Sankey* - Flow diagrams showing quantities between nodes
* *Chord* - Circular relationship diagrams

=== Specialized Layouts

* *Edge Bundling* - Hierarchical edge bundling for dense graphs
* *State Machine* - Layout for state machine diagrams
* *Adjacency* - Matrix-based adjacency layouts

== Key Concepts

*Pure Functions*::
All layouts are pure - they take data and return positioned data. No side effects.

*D3 Compatibility*::
Algorithms match D3's implementations for familiar results.

*Composable*::
Layout results work naturally with hylograph-selection for rendering.
